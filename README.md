## The FLRW Model Visualized

Web tool for visualizing **the closed FLRW (Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker) model**. A WebGL port of [the NEEngine implementation](https://github.com/dmigranov/NEEngine).

Work is still in progress!

The universe is assumed to be the three-dimensional spherical space whose radius changes with time. This dependency is plotted on the left side of the page.

It is assumed that all objects' sizes remain the same as the space's radius changes. Their visible sizes, however, do change as a consequence of that.

The fact that the speed of light is finite is also taken into account. For that reason, the universe's objects appear gradually in the eyes of the observer. The order depends on the distance between those objects and the observer.
